# Virus! (by Tranjis Games)
Virus (by Tranjis Games) *Work in progress*

## TODO

* Be able to read configuration of the game from a file (like Linux .conf files)
* Add points to any body item to develop strategies in AI.
* Refactor code to have the main actions unified (i.e.: not have three different snippets that discard cards. Better have one and its appropiate log call).
* Create string resources to allow more than one language.
* End to fill Logger calls to file.
* Implement AI in all levels (easy, medium, hard) and its strategies.
* Create statistics from each move played.
* Create an ConsoleApp to allow human interaction.
* GUI in UWP with XAML.
* GUI in Unity?
